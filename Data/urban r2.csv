The answer that someone whole heartedly high as fuck would give is...""faded""There are two main reasons this is the only answer that can be given; when a person is so blazed that they fail the simple task of choosing a number out of 10 to match their current state of mind, that is when it is clear said person is on legitimately on a 10.

I take your children and thats just the start.
 I'm more costly then diamonds, more precious then gold,
The sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.
 If you need me, remember I'm easily found,
I live all around you - in schools and in town.
 I live with the rich, I live with the poor,
I live down the street and maybe next door.
 I'm made in a lab, but not like you think,
I can be made under the kitchen sink.
 In your child's closet and even in the woods,
If this scares you to death well it certainly should.
 I have many names, but there's one you know best,
I'm sure you've heard of me, my name is Crystal Meth.
 My power is awesome, try me you'll see,
But if you do, you may never break free.
 Just try me once and I might let you go,
But try me twice and I'll own your soul.
 When I possess you, you'll steal and you'll lie,
You do what you have to - just to get high.
 The crimes you'll commit for my narcotic charms,
Will be worth the pleasure you'll feel in your arms.
 You'll lie to your mother, you'll steal from your dad
When you see there tears, you should feel sad.
 But you'll forget your morals and how you were raised,
I'll be your conscience, I'll teach you my ways.
 I take kids from parents, and parents from kids
I turn people from God, and seperate friends.
 I'll take everything from you, your looks and your pride,
I'll be with you always - right by your side.
 You'll give up everything - your family, your home,
Your friends, your money, then you'll be alone.
 I'll take and take, till you have nothing more to give,
When I'm finished with you, you'll be lucky to live.
 If you try me be warned - this is no game,
If given the chance, I'll drive you insane.
 I'll ravish your body, I'll control your mind,
I'll own you completely, your soul will be mine.
 The nightmares I'll give you while lying in bed,
The voices you'll hear, from inside your head.
 The sweats, the shakes, the visions you'll see,
I want you to know these are all gifts from me.
 But then it's too late, and you'll know in your heart,
That you are mine and we shall not part.
 You'll regret that you tried me, they always do,
But you came to me, not I to you.
 You knew this would happen, many times you were told,
But you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.
 You could of said no, and just walked away,
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?
 I'll be your master, you will be my slave,
I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave.
 Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? It's all up to you.
 I can bring more misery then words can tell
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.",Don't try Crystal Meth.

 The Clean Shit The kind where you feel shit come out, see shit in the bowl, but there's no shit on the toilet paper.

 The Lincoln Log Shit 
The kind of shit that's so enormous you're afraid to flush it down without first breaking it up into little pieces with the toilet brush.

 The Peek-A-Boo Shit

469,acid," LSD or acid (lysergic acid diethylamide) is the most commonly used hallucinogen (also known as psychedlics). It is considered a typical hallucinogen causing similar effects to other hallucinogens like mescaline, psilocybin (mushrooms), and ibogaine. LSD became popular in the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s, but since then its use has been limited to people in the Rave or club scenes. According to the College Alcohol study, only 9.4% of Brown students have ever used LSD.
  LSD is usually taken by ingesting small tabs of paper (frequently placed under the tongue) which have been soaked in the liquid form of the drug then dried. In rare cases it is taken in a liquid, gelatin, or tablet form. Sometimes a dose is soaked into a sugarcube. Doses range from 20 to 100 micrograms now, though in the 1960s they ranged from 100 to 200 micrograms. Because LSD is produced illegally, it is difficult to know how strong a dose is. The effects of the drug begin in about 30 minutes and last up to 12 hours. It can be very difficult to sleep if LSD has been taken in the last 6 hours.","acid is a very powerful drug,
but it is not as damaging as many people like to portray it.

 Weed is marijuana. It's less harmful then alcohol & cigarettes put together. You can be baked, blazed, stoned, or high. You can toke, smoke, or hit. Whatever you want to call it, it's the best feeling in the world.
 Marijuana is a plant that came from the earth. If God didn't want us to have it, why would he put it here? & if you don't believe in God then here's one for you. It comes from the ground, so it's ALL natural. Nothing harmful about it.

 Go grab a blunt, bowl, joint, or bong and chill on the couch when your parents aren't home. Make sure to have some air freshner, a change of clothes, eye drops, & gum near by.
 Make it last. Don't waste it. Blow the smoke straight to the sky.

687,LED,"Light Emiting Diode  A magical light that has no other match for it. It consumes just a couple of volts (2.4 - 4.8) and VERY few mA (20-50) and in return it provides a steady and constant lightsource with a lifespan of almost 11 years!
 It's definitely a breakthrough in lighting devices since it's properties make it inexchangable with old fashioned burn-bulbs.
 Pros:
- High luminosity in low voltage - Huge lifespan
- Very low consumption
- Immediate response in current variations
 Cons:
- Cannot compete bulb luminosity in high voltages
- Very sensitive to slight voltage changes (can burn very easily)
- Cannot be used in high voltages except with the help of voltage limiters (transformers/resistances)
- Does not work with AC currents since ALL diodes have a certain unchangable polarity.
 Colour variations:
Red, Yellow, Green are the most common.
Blue and White are more recent.
Other colours in construction since the light depends on the material of the chip nested inside the LED.
 Leds exist in clear caps or in coloured caps. Clear caps usually have more power needs and also, Blue/White have increased power consumption compared to all other colours.
 A LED can be used to save lives (like in medical equipment to show your alcohol levels in your blood) or even take lives as well (like show how much battery left you have in your lightning fartgun).
 It can also be used to hypnotize some nerds who see it and just get mesmerized and can do most of the things you tell them, EXCEPT lend you some LEDs from their collection!
  Note: Subhuman creatures who know NOTHING about LEDs but have one (or more) blue LEDs in their cars (or similar vehicles/devices/appliances), should stick them up where the sun doesn't shine and not touch them and infect them with their brainlackitis.","Hey!!! Look how nice and bright these LEDs light! (Example of observation capabilities)
