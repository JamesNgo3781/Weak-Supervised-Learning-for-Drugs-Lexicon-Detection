G,0.800795568,liveburial,"Live burial has become a popular pastime for young people with too much time on their hands . Sociologists explain this hobby by pointing out that it is relatively inexpensive and , like tattoos , body piercings , and Mohawk haircuts , is another example of the sort of outrageous and tasteless conduct that typifies adolescent 'rebels without a clue . ' it has taken its place of honor , so to speak , social scientists and other communists say , beside such western fads and fashions as pet rocks , hula hoops , telephone booth stuffing , and goldfish swallowing . ; ; Edgar Allan Poe dramatizes this amusement in his short story , 'the premature burial . ' however , Poe 's narrative is not regarded as realistic by live burial enthusiasts who claim that the story is melodramatic and does a 'disservice ' to their pastime by 'making it seem horrible rather than fun . ' had Poe tried live burial himself before disparaging it in his story for the sake of producing cheap thrills and earning a few dollars from his ignorant and gullible readers , he would have characterized the experience as rapturous and divine , they contend . Once a year , in a national cemetery , live burial devotees burn copies of Poe 's story during a weenie roast . ; ; actually , like most practices , live burial is nothing new . It was a popular form of entertainment centuries ago . It is a safe practice , when performed under parental supervision or by adults . However , one should not remain buried alive for more than a few hours without proper oxygen supply . If the individual is buried in a casket ( recommended ) , a supply of food and water may be included . For those who are buried after cremation , such provisions usually are not necessary . ; ; live burial is also performed in Haiti and other Caribbean countries as a means of increasing the labor force . After being drugged and buried , superstitious natives are dug up and told that they have been brought back from the dead . As 'zombies , ' they work their masters ' plantations . Young people in the united states are not dissuaded by this practice . ' We do n't live in Haiti , ' one young man observed , 'and , like , a dude 's gotta be , like , really ignorant to join a voodoo cult . Duh ! I mean , like , whoa ! That 's just , like , totally wacko . ' ; ; the custom of live burial is believed to have begun innocently enough as a protective measure . Wounded hunters were shut up inside caves and sealed therein by massive tree trunks or boulders . Some were able to escape the caves ; others , such as those who lost a large amount of blood from the wounds inflicted by their prey ( wool mammoths or saber-tooth tigers ) tended to die in place . ; ; Simon magus buried himself alive , counting upon god to free him before he expired . However , the deity was otherwise occupied and the expected miracle never occurred . ; ; Matthew wall was on his way to a live burial when his pall-bearers , being rather clumsy oafs , dropped his casket , thereby spilling his 'remains ' onto the ground . He picked himself off , dusted himself off , and celebrated his 'resurrection ' every year , thereby popularizing live burials in England , the land of his birth and near-death experience . ; ; it is believed that legends of vampires resulted from the unintended live burials of catatonic or epileptic people who , awakening inside a dark and silent coffin , scratched at the wood , rolled over , or otherwise behaved in an unseemly and irresponsible manner . Sarah Michelle cellar , who played a vampire slayer on TV , confirmed the existence of vampires , explaining that she used to see them every day . In testimony before the u . s . senate committee on foolish teenage pranks , she also stated that 'numerous adolescents enjoy live burials as something to do on a Saturday night or as a way to rebel against life and stuff . ' she says that she has been buried alive so many times that TV and film critics refer to her as 'one of the walking dead . ' Sean Penn has also been criticized as performing roles worthy of a 'dead man walking . ' ; ; Robert Ripley , author of Ripley 's belief in it or not , revived live burials by encouraging youth to compete with one another , nationally and internationally , for the world 's record for the longest live burial . The winner was IRA stinker , of cadavers county , California , but she was disqualified when it was discovered that she 'd had herself embalmed before her burial and was , therefore , 'technically dead . ' first place went to her runner-up , d . compose , who managed to stay buried for nearly three days , subsisting on finger sandwiches , toe cheese , and ribs supplied by surrounding corpses and drinking his own urine . 'It was n't exactly a diet of nectar and ambrosia , but it served its purpose , ' he said of his meals . ; ; compose said that he and his friends practiced for the 'real thing ' by burying themselves in sand at a popular nude beach , leaving only their heads exposed . This worked well in helping them to adjust to spending long periods being immobile , but an unpleasant side effect was being at the mercy of urinating dogs , incoming surf , and beached jellyfish and 'seeing people 's private parts up close , from a worm 's eye view--phew !

G,0.838750307,mdma,"mama ; ; ( c11h15no2 ) ; ; ( methylenedioxy-n-methylamphetamine ) ; ; description ; ; mama , or 'ecstasy ' is a 'psychedelic amphetamine ' that has gained popularity over the past 20 years because of its ability to produce strong feelings of comfort , empathy , and connection to others . It most frequently comes in tablet form , although it is occasionally sold in capsules or as powder . It is most frequently used orally and rarely snorted . mama use is closely tied to the underground rave ( and dance club ) scene throughout the world , but has also been widely used by therapists as an adjunct to psychotherapy . ; ; because mama is so popular and because it goes well with dance parties , the demand for it usually exceeds supply--especially at any given location on any given night . This creates an opening for unscrupulous individuals to sell virtually anything as 'ecstasy ' . While 'ecstasy ' is the popular name for mama , the functional definition of ecstasy is any pill represented as mama on the street . Ecstasy pills are notoriously unreliable in content , more so than most other street drugs , and commonly contain either caffeine , ephedrine , amphetamines , MA , made , dam , or--in rare cases--dob , and do n't necessarily contain mama or any psychoactive . This problem has led to the development of simple mama testing kits that may help give the user a general sense of the content of a pill . ; ; dose ; ; a standard oral dose of mama is between 80 - 150 mg . most good quality pills contain somewhere in this range , generally 80-120 mg . a large percentage of users find that , unlike with many other psychoactive such as LSD or mushrooms , there is a 'sweet spot ' in mama dosage . Once this spot is found , higher dosages are not particularly desirable as they do n't increase the sought after effects or duration . ; ; price ; ; the price of mama varies wildly depending on where it 's purchased and in what quantity . A single tablet bought at a rave can cost as much as $ 50 though more commonly $ 20-$ 30 . Purchased in higher quantities ' mama generally sells for $ 100-$ 250 per gram ( about $ 10-25 per dose ) , with wholesale prices as low as $ 50 per gram . ; ; law ; ; mama is illegal in the united states (schedule i ) and in most other countries . It is also listed as schedule i in the international convention on psychotropic substances , an international drug control treaty . ; ; chemistry ; ; 3,4-methylenedioxy-n-methamphetamine ( mama ) is a synthetic chemical that can be derived from an essential oil of the sassafras tree . ; ; history ; ; mama was first synthesized and patented by Merck pharmaceuticals in 1912 and patented in 1914 , but it was n't until the mid 1970s that articles related to its psycho activity began showing up in scholarly journals . In the late '70s and early '80s mama was used as a psycho therapeutic tool and also started to become available on the street . Its growing popularity led to it being made illegal in the united states in 1985 and its popularity has continued to increase since then . ; ; slang ; ; the substance : [mama] , [ecstasy] , [x] , [etc] , [e] , m , Adam , [bean] , [roll] , ; ; the experience : going , [rolling] , [tripping] , [wigging ] ; ; onset ; ; depending on how much and how recently one has eaten , mama generally takes 30-60 minutes ( although sometimes as long as 2 hours ) to take effect . Unlike with many other psychoactive , the onset of mama is very quick . Often at the point one realizes that perhaps they are starting to notice effects , they are already 'launching ' quickly towards the peak .

For many people there is an additional period (2-6 hrs ) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality , but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping ' . Many people also experience a noticeable shift in mood for several days after use ; for some this is a period of depression while others experience lifted mood . ; ; the experience ; ; when the full effects of mama manifest , barring an uncommon negative reaction , users are likely to find that suddenly everything is right with the world . The primary effects sought by those using mama recreation ally are the emotional openness , euphoria , stimulation , reduction of critical and cynical thoughts , and decrease of inhibitions that can accompany its use . mama is used by some individuals in a therapeutic setting to attempt to work through difficult interpersonal issues .

G,0.808288569,montclair,"Commuter suburb in Essex county , NJ , about 15 miles from Manhattan . Divided into about three sections . Section 1 : the 'ghetto ' of southeastern and east central monthlies , mostly composed of vaguely derelict multifamily houses and vacant laundromats , and black with a few Sikhs in population . Known as an infamous drug trading area for everyone in suburban Essex county . The area between glen field park and glen ridge avenue is typically considered the worst area , where over 1/2 the businesses are vacant and most of the houses appear to be in a state of disrepair . It is also home to lackawanna plaza , a discount shopping center . Black people have lived in the area south of Bloomfield avenue in east monthlies since the 1700s , and the area north of Bloomfield avenue is originally a very old Italian neighborhood that is now primarily black , but with some Sikhs . 2. Downtown montclair-an expanding area centered on the fairly trendy business area around Bloomfield avenue , church street , Fullerton avenue , midland avenue , and walnut street . This is home to many boutiques , restaurants , art house movie theaters , bookstores , galleries , and a dis ordinate number of antique stores for such a small town . The residential areas of downtown monthlies range from primarily white luxury apartments and restored Victorian two-family houses off Bloomfield avenue to multi million dollar houses near Essex park and down south mountain avenue towards the eagle rock reservation . Upper mountain avenue in the vicinity of downtown monthlies is the home of the wealthiest part of upper mountain avenue , which offers multi million dollar mansions and NYC views , and is arguably the most exclusive street in suburban Essex county . Downtown monthlies has spawned a breed of white rich kids who think of themselves as the hippest , hottest thing in the universe . Most of the people who are downtown monthlies users are either yuppies , part of an expat community of twenty , thirty , and forty somethings from NYC , or bored , self-absorbed teenagers . Downtown monthlies also includes most of claimant avenue , a somewhat dangerous and deserted residential boulevard . Home of monthlies high school , infamous as home of racial rioting and rich white indie kids . 3. Upper montclair-the very , very wealthy , totally white and primarily residential area north of watching avenue . Known as the home of private high schools like lacordaire academy and monthlies Kimberley academy , both used by upper monthlies residents and residents from towns to the west . Upper monthlies is very middle-aged white and teenager and totally boring and quaint . The main business strip is valley road , seconded by watching avenue . People from downtown monthlies view it as the epitome of the rich white people who they think they are n't , even though upper monthlies people do happen to be sheltered , obnoxious , and when not old money , act like they 're old money . monthlies is , finally , known for the attitude of thinking itself diverse ( by the white people ) but being , in actuality , totally segregated , even among the black people . The wealthier blacks live towards west orange while the poorest towards glen field park . It 's an ideal example of the hypocritical secret racism by white liberals on a smaller scale , as opposed to the occurrence in NYC , which is on too large a scale to thoroughly socially examine .
