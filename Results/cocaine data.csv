C,guncontrol,"Murderous London is like old new York ; ; by Janet Daley ; ; ( filed : 01/12/2004 ) ; ; what is happening to London ? Where is the cheerful , relaxed , 'swinging ' city that I found when I arrived in the 1960s ? That was when Chelsea meant the king 's road scene and 'debs ' ( as they were called then ) living in what everybody regarded as an enclave of sheltered privilege . ; ; now there has been a murderous attack , at an early hour of the evening , inside one of those very homes that would be regarded as almost ethereally superior . In nothing hill , they have grown accustomed to being mugged . That is a neighborhood which , for all its status , is euphemistically described as 'mixed ' . You have your good restaurants and your local dinner-party circuit , but you pay for your chic address by avoiding the tube station at night . ; ; up the road in Holland park , some friends of mine have installed electronic security gates outside their house , but that did not prevent a laptop computer - containing irreplaceable research - from being stolen from their car in the drive . Over in Arlington , they pretty much expect to be burgled . ; ; it goes with the cool urban territory . But somehow change row in Chelsea still seemed like another league . If that kind of wealth and influence ca n't buy you protection from a bestial attack , then who is safe ? What chance for the poor on their sink estates who are being terrorized by the local drug gangs , or the middle-class suburban homeowners trying to avoid the routine loss of their possessions in opportunistic break-ins ? ; ; there was a time , not so long ago , when the wealthy inhabitants of new York 's upper east side used to walk out of their fifth avenue apartment buildings with a dog on a lead on one arm and a bodyguard on the other . On the upper west side , one Columbia university professor told me , they did not lock their cars at night because the homeless used them to sleep in : if vagrants had to go to the trouble of breaking into your car , they would take their revenge by urinating ( or worse ) on the upholstery . You were better off just accommodating their wishes . ; ; crack cocaine was openly sold on the street in Harlem , and the subway was so dangerous that an army of vigilantes with red berets had taken it upon themselves to try to restore order where the police had given up . property values , even in this fabulously prosperous city , were in free-fall . Well , we all know what happened next . Somebody had a brilliant idea that turned the old theory about how to deal with a major crime epidemic on its head . ; ; paradoxically , the way you confronted big crime was by dealing persistently and rigorously with little crime . It was jams q Wilson 's now legendary 'broken windows ' hypothesis which stated that when a neighborhood , or a city , had become rundown and uncared-for - when its buildings and trains were covered in graffiti , its streets strewn with rubbish , and its youth allowed to indulge in flagrant displays of delinquent bravado - a climate was created in which serious crimes such as murder and robbery could run amok . ; ; and so , as William brat ton , the now deified ex-police chief of new York , says , they 'took the city back block by block ' . They power-hosed the graffiti and banged up the street-corner drug pushers . They arrested the young hoodlums who regularly jumped over the subway turnstiles without paying a fare ( and who turned out , as often as not , to be big operators carrying illegal weapons ) . ; ; they sped up the prosecutions of everybody they caught with all-night court sittings ( some of them held on traveling courts bused around the city at night ) . They got uniformed police on to the streets as a visible deterrent , and undercover ones into the trouble spots to gain intelligence and take criminals by surprise . ( if you are , by some remote chance , approached by an unsavory character in new York now , you are likely to find yourself quickly surrounded by plain-clothes police who will seem to have materialized from nowhere . ) ; ; they got a grip . And they succeeded because somebody had a counter-intuitive idea ( crack down on the small offenses even though you are worried about the big ones ) . Then some other people - the Manhattan institute think tank - had the foresight and the intellectual initiative to sell the idea . ; ; then a mayor , Rudolph Giuliani , had the courage to endorse the idea and stake his political credibility on it . then a tirelessly dedicated police chief put the idea into practice , even though it meant flying in the face of all the liberal received wisdom about softly-softly justice and not 'criminalizing ' people who had committed minor offenses , blah-blah-blah . ; ; you will have noticed that this is precisely the opposite of what is happening here . Try ringing the police to tell them about an act of vandalism that is going on before your eyes and you will be treated with scarcely concealed ridicule : we 've got more important things to worry about than some kids smashing up a building site . Never mind that the kids who have got away with that are likely to conclude that they can get away with pretty much anything . ; ; now new workers have their city back and we are losing ours . And yesterday 's horrific news showed the extent to which we are all in this together , from the derelict council estates in tower hamlets to millionaires ' row in Chelsea . When I spoke to brat ton a couple of years ago , his proudest boast was that they had brought normal social life back to Harlem . ; ; most of the population used to stay in at night up there , he said . They just left the streets to the bad guys with their guns and their drug turf wars . But now , there were restaurants and night clubs and movie theaters where ordinary decent people went for a good time in the evening . They have been freed from fear all the way from the battery to the top of park avenue . When is it our turn ? ",n
