1766,ptown,"P town is an abbreviated term for a small city in northern California , more commonly known as Pacific . As many of you may or may not know , Pacific is home of the infamous Linda mar shopping center , which contains extremely important stores such as slave way , rite aid , and Ross . Where would pacific ans be without slave way , a place to visit various Terra nova high school students and make them cart your groceries to your car ? Where would pacific ans be without the utterly useless rite aid , which is no more than a pathetic , but newly renovated , hopeless place to steal an assortment of widely used alcoholic beverages ? where the fuck would pacific ans be without Ross ? ; ; a place for the elderly to purchase clothes and for teenagers , especially chicks , to purchase the same blouse as the next chick , awaiting the day they both wear it on the same day and both try to hide the fact that they actually shop at Ross . Pacific is a place where public service workers , such as policemen and firefighters enjoy constantly asking for donations , when in fact , that 's the last thing they need . I suggest , the Pacific fire department get a fucking Dalmatian , so they can at least look appealing to children ( through daily field-trips to elementary schools due to the fact that they have no actual emergencies ever , except for the occasional suicide attempt/pitiful fight attempted by Terra nova students ) . I suggest that every police take their fucking blinding flashlights and stick them up their fucking asses and take their damn cuffs and use them to fuck each other ( at least with style ) . P town is also a huge carrier of a very commonly used drug known as marijuana . Not only is it bought buy everyone and their fathers , but it is also sold buy the same people who buy it and smoke it . the funny thing is , is that the retailers of weed try to screw over their customers by raising the price ( when in fact they probably have enough weed stashed away in a tin can somewhere ) . It is a known fact that everyone has driven thru Pacific and it is also known that no one actually takes the time to stop here . ash yes , the b.o.v. a place where people declare it is a 'stuff living ' , and it is sad to say that people in manor probably have it the toughest . Another funny fascination : teenagers who live in Linda mar and even manor think they wo n't see customers they know by working at the manor slave way . *chuckle* , but idiots . I say they see more people they know at manor than any other store ( and just to let you know , for those of you working at manor slave way , customers find it much more embarrassing to have to show the courtesy and admit they know you by saying hi to you , than you do by just seeing them ) . O finally , the positives about Pacific . [which unfortunately turn to negatives sooner or later ] one word : beach . I find it humorous to think of the wide variety of people who surf in Pacific , ranging from old fogies to the littlest of children . I would just like to say , yes , it must be very difficult to fall off your board 50 times in 30 mind trying to surf 3 foot ( at the most ) waves . I enjoy seeing the comedic action while cruising down highway 1 . No, the beach is good for plain old sandy fun...nothing more . Go surf somewhere more worthwhile . Please . it 's too cold in those waters anyways . Who could forget the wonderful beachfront taco bell !
